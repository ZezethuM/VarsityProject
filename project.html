			<h2>Library requisition form</h2>
			<p>In the project we have been tasked to create a library online requisition form as they wantn to do away with the manual one they have been using over the year.<br>We have been grouped in groups of four to complete the task.<br> The project basically requires us to make an online form that will be accessed by the lectures in order to make book suggestion or request books they want, and also by the HOD of that department inoder to approve request or not and send request to the library to buy for the following year or current year. This form will be accessed also by the libririan and will be able to give feed back wether books will be available or not depending on their budget. Students will only be told by the lecturer when books are available.</p>
