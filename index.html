  				<p>My name is <b>Zezethu Mnayamalala</b> and i aspire to be a Database Analyst.</p>
  				<hr>
  				<p> Database Analysts organize and make sense of collections of information in order to create functional database systems. They evaluate, design, review, and implement databases. They are also hired to maintain and update existing databases to better serve the needs of businesses. Database Analysts may also play a role in the security of databases and assist in training employees on the proper use of databases.

				Database Analysts perform a large part of their work independently, but they must confer regularly with management and Database Administrators to ensure they are collecting and organizing the information in the manner the business requires.</p>
				<p>Database Analysts must be able to gather pertinent information and organize it in a logical and functional manner. They will consult with management or administrators to determine what data needs to be included in the database system and will then find the best ways to organize and store this information. They will often create flowcharts and diagrams during this stage of data construction to illustrate how the data will be sorted and stored.</p>
				<p>A successful Database Analyst must be technically-inclined, a great problem-solver and possess excellent interpersonal skills. They are extremely reliable and enjoy working in teams and independently. They should also work well under pressure and tight deadlines.</p>
